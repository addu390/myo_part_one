A simple library developed for my final year project : Myo Electric Prosthetic Arm

MYO Band (https://myo.com) connected to a Raspberry pi 3 which controls a 3D printed prosthetic arm powered by servo motors.
The signals received from the MYO band is sent to the micro-processor over bluetooth, which is further processed and falls under one of the pre-defined 13 patterns such as FIST, GRAB, POINT (For finger), PINCH and several more, these patterns are specific to individual users and tweaked accordingly, as the myo signals depends on several factors of the residual arm.
